Here you can place a snap or custom video in ".mp4" format to play instead of random snap videos.

Respect system format, place a 16/9 video for a 16/9 system..or 4/3 for 4/3.

Name must be "snap.mp4"


You can add a video named "default.mp4", this will make this video play in systemview for non scrapped games when random system falling on non scrapped game.(exemple: megadrive pub or generalist video)
