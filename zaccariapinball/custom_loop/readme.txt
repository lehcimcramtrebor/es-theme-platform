Here you can place a video named "loop.mp4", you must edit "_LAYOUT_SETTINGS.xml" and select "yes" at "LOOP video background", this will replace image background
by your loop video background.
 
Use 16/9 video if you want to use both fullhd and vga modes.

You can use 4/3 video if you display your theme only on vga mode.
